# ATGC

DNA nucleotides Mass Ratio using natural units (mol,GeV,m_n,m_p,m_e...)

We’re checking two equations:  (1) C + G = A + T + 1  (2) A + T = C + G – 1

Assumptions and Conclusions
ACGT (DNA):
A-T Pairing: Adenine (A) and Thymine (T) form base pairs with relatively close molar masses. This suggests balanced contributions to DNA molecular structure.

C-G Pairing: Cytosine (C) and Guanine (G) are heavier, reflecting their triple hydrogen bonds and stronger bonding in DNA stability.
